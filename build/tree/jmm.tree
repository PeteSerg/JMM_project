state Go to park
    prompt Dashing across the street you rush headlong into the park heading towards the wooded trails right along the wall. \nBehind you, you hear the slam of car doors as two of Argoyle's men give chase. \nHitting the woods at a dead sprint the trees fly by on either side of the path. \nThrough them glimpses of the wall can be seen. No one knew what the glowing, ever shifting, wall was made of. \nOnly that it was deadly to the touch. Probably a better way to go out than whatever Argoyle will do to you. \nAhead of you is a crossroads.
