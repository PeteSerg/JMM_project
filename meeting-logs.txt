- Started to plan out what the project will look like
and continued to brainstorm ideas for what kind of game we would
like to make. Also browsed what kind of tools will be used in 
order to create a functioning game.

09/09/2021

- Created the team repository on Github and started to 
work on the first team presentation. Team roles were discussed as
well as what kind of story we would like to pursue in the text-based
aspect of the game.

09/14/2021

- Discussed how graphics will be implemented into the game as well as
a way to format the window. It was decided that SFML will be the library
that will be used to create the game since it supports things like graphics,
separate game windows, and audio capabilities.

09/16/2021

- Spent time with the team and planned out what each game window will look
like when it is rendered and what will be expected from the player as they
continue to play through the game. Started to try and run SFML on each team
members home computer so that they are able to develop and make contributions
to the team repository.

09/21/2021

- Worked on the homework assignment involving our team project and creating 
different branches to see how it works when different outcomes are being experimented
with by different members. This led to a "topdown" and "main" branch of the game
where one consisted of a character running around a screen to test functionality of
movement in SFML and the other was more of a text-based approach with graphics.

09/23/2021

- Got story updates from Owen and decided how branching would work. It was 
discussed whether or not different decisions would lead to completely different
games or if decisions would ultimately lead to similar stories. The second option was
chosen because it will make it less complicated to program stories when there are not
four completely different branches at each crossroad.

09/28/2021

- Continued to work on story prompts mainly and discussed which direction we would
like to go at each decision in the game. Also created windows for main and topdown that
mirrored what we had discussed at previous meetings, with a moving graphic and a still-graphic
with text options.

09/30/2021

- Spent time with team members troubleshooting SFML so that each member could compile source
code on their local branches. This involved linking the SFML library and including certain
header files through paths on compilation but it was still unsuccessful with some of the team
members, we will continue to try and solve this issue.

10/05/2021

- Met with the team to work on our first checkpoint presentation, this consisted of updates
relating to our work that had been done so far, mainly adding a user interface based on
prototype designs made in class and discussed in previous meetings. Goals were set for the future,
our main focus is to finish the story so that each team member can focus on programming.

10/07/2021

- Different routes were discussed with the game such as providing a main menu where the user
would be able to start the game, exit, or go to more options. This will involve more training 
with SFML and will still require that the program function correctly on member's computers.
Compilation is still an issue and is being resolved.

10/12/2021

- Continued to write story branches that are based on each user decision at certain points in
the game. Also set up SFML tutorial programs on each computer so that it could be determined
if SFML would run locally. We worked on cutting down bulky parts of the story so that it would
be a quicker read for the player.

10/14/2021

- Started to work on the second team checkpoint, this involved creating a flowchart so that our
story could be better understood and less complicated. We also committed to the non-topdown approach
to the game, instead opting for a text-based with graphics approach, this will allow the story to be 
able to be implemented easier. Also started to prepare a base program for the upcoming live demo.

10/19/2021

- Finalized the main script for our story so that each team member could start to focus more
on programming, although we will still be adding to the story as time goes on and more branches
to each decision are required.

10/21/2021

- Started to seriously discuss creating a menu that was discussed at a previous meeting. The menu would 
allow the user to simply cycle through three options, play, options, and exit. Each option when selected
would take the player to the desired screen. More research will be needed to implement this using
the SFML library.

10/26/2021

- We began to discuss implementation of navigation between the SFML windows. This will allow the player
to be able to switch screens and continue through the game. This will involve more research into the SFML
library. We also continue to discuss how the story will progress so that a more complete idea can be 
visualized and planned for.

10/28/2021

- Resolved a problem with compilation so that a build file could be made. The build file now holds an
executable that can be run on everyone's computer and receive input and change according to the input.
This is a huge step toward being able to run SFML on everyone's computer.

11/2/2021

- We began to implement a decision tree that will relate to decisions the user makes at different points
within the game. The tree handles different states that depend on what the user chooses and these choices
are displayed beneath sprites on the screen. Currently only one sprite is being used but we have discussed
the creation of others that relate to each choice.

11/4/2021

- We spent time discussing issues that a team member was having with the SFML window not showing fully on
their screen. It was discovered that each player may not have the resolution that was originally programmed
so we must now implement the drawing of a canvas that can adapt to each players screen so they are able to 
view the entirety of the game. This will involve more research into how windows are rendered using SFML
functions.

11/9/2021

- Now that a story has been written and a tree has been created to handle different decisions in the story,
we are discussing into more depth how sprites will be added so that the game can have a graphic component.
This will involve creating a strip or array of pictures and then selecting certain sprites as the scenes
continue. We also gave updates on our progress and continue to code different scenes for the final story
tree.

11/11/2021

- We discussed how our final phase of the project will continue. The first issue that will be addressed
is the ability of new lines to be able to be read by the window so that prompts can display correctly.
A menu is also still being worked on so that the game has a real starting point. A new feature that will
also be implemented is the ability to switch decision trees using the command line so multiple trees can
be tested.

11/16/2021

- We talked about how we will prepare for the final presentation of the project and what still needs to
be done, as well as delegating tasks to each team member. The tasks include updating the end flowchart
for the story so the tree can be implemented easier, creating a working menu, and creating a full list
of sprites that are able to be used at different points in the story.

11/18/2021

- The team gave updates on their progress since the past meeting. A menu has been developed and the process
of creating decision trees for the game was refined so that it is easier for team members to switch to 
certain pictures relating to the prompts. The project was also ran through different tools to be analyzed
and documented.
