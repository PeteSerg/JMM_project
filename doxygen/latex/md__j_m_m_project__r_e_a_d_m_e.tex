This is a prototype. Renders an animation, and allows the player to enter text at the top of the screen. All you can do is 1. exit with escape, 2. exit by entering \char`\"{}exit\char`\"{}, or 3. stop animation by entering \char`\"{}stop\char`\"{}\hypertarget{md__j_m_m_project__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Build}\label{md__j_m_m_project__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}

Our group is making a text based adventure game. Our goal is to make a game with multiple paths for the player to explore. We\textquotesingle{}re hoping to include simple visuals and graphics with each stage.\hypertarget{md__j_m_m_project__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Date \& Time}\label{md__j_m_m_project__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item 1. We will use the programming language C++ as our main base for the project, and possibly use SFML to implement graphics for the game
\item We will use VScode as our editor
\item For version control we are going to be using Github so that we can easily make changes and be able to keep track of them, given that this is the version control manager we are all most comfortable with

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We are using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to handle graphics
\item We are using VSCode\textquotesingle{}s Intelli\+Sense to easily reference documentation elsewhere in our code. We are using no tools to generate documentation at this time.
\item There should be a build system. We will probably use make, and we may use premake.
